## Usage
In order to use this, ensure you have the .html file downloaded on your USB flash drive.
After downloading it and plugging it into the computer you want to use to run it, open the .html file and use it (create an
entry, etc.). Do not worry about constantly saving, as the data will be saved in your computer's cache.
After you are finished, click export and save the .JSON file to your USB drive (preferably). 

If you want to use it on another computer afterward, plug in your USB and click "choose file" to choose the JSON file, and then clicking the import button. 
For maximum security, consider clearing the browser data/cookies/cache afterwards (for how long you used the journal.html file).

All of the data is encrypted, with the key travelling with the .JSON file.
